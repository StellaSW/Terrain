# terrain

a graphics program using C/C++ and OpenGL to produce and  display  an  interactive  terrain  mesh.  Terrain  meshes  are models typically comprised of either triangle or quad polygons that  make  up  a  3D  surface.  They are  often  used  to  represent outdoor virtual environments (e.g., fields, hills, mountains, etc.). An example terrain is shown to the right. For the purpose of your assignment, you will need to represent the terrain as a heightmap (a 2D array of height values), procedurally produce height values according to a specified algorithm, and display the resulting terrain using either triangle or quad (strip) primitives.

The following commands display all the options available in this terrain program

w : Switch mode(1. solid polygons; 2. wireframe; 3. both of them)

l : Enable Lighting

k : Disable Lighting

f : Switch between circle algorithm and fault algorithm

s : Switch between flat shading and Gouraud shading

r : Random Terrain

q : Quit

arrow keys and 'a' 'd': Rotate camera by x, y, z axis
